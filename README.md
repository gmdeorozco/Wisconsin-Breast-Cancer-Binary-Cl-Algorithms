# Binary Classification Algorithms Comparison

![Binary Classification](https://img.shields.io/badge/Binary%20Classification-Algorithms%20Comparison-blue)

This GitHub repository provides a comprehensive comparison of various binary classification algorithms using the well-known Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The goal of this project is to assess the performance and characteristics of different algorithms when applied to the task of classifying breast cancer as malignant or benign.

## Dataset - Breast Cancer Wisconsin

The [Breast Cancer Wisconsin](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29) dataset is a widely used dataset for binary classification tasks in machine learning. It contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The features describe the characteristics of cell nuclei present in the image.

## Algorithms Compared

The following binary classification algorithms are compared in this project:

1. Logistic Regression
2. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Decision Tree
5. Random Forest
6. Gradient Boosting
7. Naive Bayes
8. Neural Network

## Evaluation Metrics

To assess the performance of each algorithm, the following evaluation metrics are used:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall (Sensitivity)
- F1 Score
- ROC AUC


## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine.
